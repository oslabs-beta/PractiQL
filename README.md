**PractiQL** is an open-source, browser-based, GraphQL IDE. Users can send a single query to a GraphQL API or send out multiple queries simultaneously. Users also have the ability to click nodes on a treelist representing the target schema and have queries automatically generated for an intuitive experience designed to improve developer workflow.

## <b>Multiple Queries Simultaneously</b>
PractiQL provides users with the ability to create and send out multiple queries at once without the need for GraphQL aliases. Results are returned in separate code blocks, including results for queries to the same field, for an intuitive and expedited experience with little mental overhead. 
Send a bunch of queries. Get a bunch of responses. It just works.

## <b>Write a Bunch of Queries. Send the Ones You Want</b>
Users also have the option to send out different combinations of multiple queries. It’s as easy as highlighting the queries you want to send and sending them.

## <b>Schema Trees</b>
PractiQL can render a tree list model of a target GraphQL API for an easy-to-navigate representation of the schema. We call the models schema trees, and they’re a quick and organized way to view and interact with entire GraphQL schemas at once.
<br />
<br/>
## <b>Automatically Generated Queries</b>
Users also have the ability to generate queries by clicking on the nodes of the schema tree instead of typing those queries out manually. The result is an extremely intuitive experience and improved developer workflow that’s especially useful when testing new GraphQL APIs. 
No more guessing. No more relying on auto-completed fields. Generate queries as you’re browsing the schema.

## <b>Saved Queries</b>
Navigated away from PractiQL? No problem. Queries are saved in local storage and populate automatically when you return.
